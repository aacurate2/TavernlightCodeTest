## PROBLEM: 
Presumably a typo in the function name, also `memberCount` wasn't an incredibly descriptive name for what that var was used for.

## SOLUTION: 
Rename them!

## METHODOLOGY:
There wasn't much for this one, just look at the names and decide they were inefficient. I did also check the function calls for validity, focused on that SQL syntax. Although my SQL is rusty, it looks valid from what I can gather. I also thought `result` was actually meant to be the var `resultId` before I looked into how `result` works. It was then that I realized `resultId` is actually an error code, and therefore should be checked before proceeding!
